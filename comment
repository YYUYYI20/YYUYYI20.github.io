MGFxFx gives far better modelling with than 2.2.11 in VVMergHP region (2btag, VBF case are lack of statisctics)
MGFxFx gives very similiar modelling with sherpa 2.2.11 in VVMergLP region (2btag, VBF case are lack of statisctics)
MGFxFx gives very similiar modelling with sherpa 2.2.11 in VVRes region (slightly better for VBF case)
VH_Merg region is extremely lack of statistics
MGFxFx gives better modelling in VH Res region, especially for the high statistical bins of m and pT disributions, 2btag region, VBF case


In summary: MG FxFx gives better modelling for CRs of VH, VBF, high pT VV --- good moelling for hard glue spilling to HF jets
